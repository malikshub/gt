                        <h2>Improve Your Aim</h2>
                        <p>
                            Are you annoyed by grinding in the lower ranks and struggling to get to the upper ranks. 
                            Here are some common mistakes that people usually make in the lower ranks and by preventing
                            such mistakes you can easily rank yourself up. These tips are not specific to any perticular
                            game and can be used in almost every game including Valorant, Apex Legends, CS-GO, COD Warzone
                            and even several mobile games.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <h2><li>Right Crossair Placement</li></h2>
                            <p>The most common mistake which people make is the wrong crosshair placement. 
                                I have seen players in lower ranks play with their crosshair placed at either too low 
                                or high position, placing their crosshair right at the enemy's head will give them one 
                                advantage over their enemy .i.e they can save the amount of time which they would take 
                                to get their crosshair from the wrong place to the enemy's head.</p>
                            
                            <h2><li>Improving Your Game Sense</li></h2>
                            <p>If you know from where the enemy can come, or where they can be will help you get your
                                 aim better as you already know from where he will come from. And when you know the 
                                 place from where your enemy can come from, then you can set your crosshair according 
                                 to the enemy's head before you even actually see him. The only way to improve your 
                                 game sense is by playing more and more.</p>
                            <p>Collecting information in between games can be really useful, so you can focus on things 
                                such as footsteps' sound, looking at minimap 
                                in between games, talking to team-mates and taking information about enemy's position,
                                health-point, etc. which would also help you improve your game sense.</p>
                            
                            <h2><li>Aim Practice and Trainings</li></h2>
                            <p>Practising your aim is really important, if your aim is not that good you need to 
                                focus on the above two points till you make your aim better. Game sense and 
                                crosshair placement are way more important than just crisp and precise aim.</p>
                            <p>Although daily practice and an aim routine can help build a crisp and precise aim. 
                                Most games have an in-game range where you can practice your aim with the help of 
                                bots, games like Valorant and Apex Legends both have a great in-game range, Apex 
                                Legends has a range where you can practice with your friends which would make aim 
                                practice more interesting and enjoyable where as Valorant has a range in which you 
                                can practice your aim as well as different moves such as jiggles, crouch-jump, etc.</p>
                               
                            <h2><li>Setting Up A Aim Routine</li></h2>
                            <p>Sometimes you may feel that the in-game range isn't sufficient for your aim training, 
                                then you might need a better aim trainer such as AimLabs which provide you with a better 
                                environment for the aim practice with several modes which are made to make your aim better, 
                                Aimlabs has various playlist which has several modes arranged in a particular order to make 
                                your aim better within a minimum period of time.</p>

                            <h2><li>Recoil Contorl</li></h2>
                            <p>Last but not least recoil control is also one of the major factors which make 
                                aiming more difficult. Recoil (in-game) can be explained as a pattern, which a 
                                gun follows when fired continuously similar to how a gun in real life kickbacks
                                 when fired. Every gun has a similar pattern of recoil which you can see just by 
                                 firing continuously on a wall without making any movement, to control recoil 
                                 simply make that pattern in reverse to counter the recoil, for example as most 
                                 guns have upward recoil so we generally drag our mouse downwards to counter that 
                                 recoiol. </p>
